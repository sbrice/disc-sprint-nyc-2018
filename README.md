## Featured Hacks
Not confident in your coding chops? Want to learn more about how to use Jupyter? Have something else in mind? No problem! Let us know what you'd like to learn and we'll show you how Jupyter can make the experience easier.

* [Letâ€™s Make an xkcd JupyterLab Extension](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/developer/xkcd_extension_tutorial.html#xkcd-extension-tutorial) (Beginner)
  
  Create your own JupyterLab Extension and publish it to GitHub and NPM.

  - **Prerequisites:** Some programming experience. No prior Python or JupyterLab experience necessary.

  - **Facilitators:** [Jessica Ford](https://github.com/jzf2101), [Steve Silvester](https://github.com/blink1073)

* [Practical machine learning with the Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/sbrice/practical-ml) (Intermediate)

  Walk through developing a machine learning pipeline, from prototyping to production, with the Jupyter platform. Using the **[Recommendation engine](https://github.com/sbrice/practical-ml/tree/master/recommendation)** or **[Anomaly detection](https://github.com/sbrice/practical-ml/tree/master/anomaly)** notebook learn at your own pace and seek help from the facilitators as you need it. Prior programming experience required. 

  - **Prerequisites:** Python programming experience, basic familiarity with math (e.g. linear algebra), and data analysis.

  - **Facilitators:** [Jane Adams](https://github.com/thejunglejane), [Samuel Brice](https://github.com/sbrice)

* [Get Started with TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/) (Advanced)

  Learn and use ML by going through some beginner-friendly notebook examples. We'll go through training a neural network to classify images and text. This is a fast-paced overview of complete TensorFlow programs with the details explained as we go. Prior experience with Python and Jupyter required.

  - **Prerequisites:** Python programming experience, basic familiarity with math (e.g. linear algebra), and data analysis.

  - **Facilitators:** [Samuel Brice](https://github.com/sbrice)

Based on interest we'll create workshops focused on the above topics. If you have something else in mind feel free to email Sam Brice (brices@gmail.com).
